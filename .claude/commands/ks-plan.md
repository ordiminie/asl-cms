You are planning a story's implementation. Target story: $ARGUMENTS

Resolve $ARGUMENTS to the story id (`s<number>-<slug>`) against docs/stories.md. If there is no unambiguous match, list the available stories and stop.

Read: docs/stories.md (the target story), docs/research/<id>.md (if it exists), docs/design-system.md and docs/designs/<id>.md (if they exist), docs/architecture.md, AGENTS.md
Output structure: @templates/plan.md

If docs/research/<id>.md doesn't exist, point out that /ks-research <id> is recommended before planning — without research, the plan relies on possibly stale docs. Continue only if I confirm.

If the story has UI, the plan follows the screen defined in docs/designs/<id>.md: it references the design system's components and never invents new ones. The HTML mockup is a reference, not a source of code.

Proceed as follows:
1. Isolate the target story and its acceptance criteria.
2. Break it into ordered tasks, each one small and verifiable. Lean on the research: real files, verified APIs, known traps. A task that can't fail a test isn't a task — merge it into one that can.
3. Anticipate the touched files and the test strategy. If the story is scored complexity 5, or the plan grows past roughly ten tasks, the story is too big: say so and suggest a split instead of a bloated plan.
4. If planning forces a structural choice (library, pattern, data model) with rejected alternatives, record it as an ADR in `docs/decisions/` (@templates/adr.md) — it will travel with the story branch.
5. Write the plan to `docs/plans/<id>.md`, frontmatter `validated: no`.
6. Validation checkpoint (AskUserQuestion): "Validate this plan?" — options: Validate / I'll review it first. On Validate, set `validated: yes` in the plan's frontmatter. /ks-execute refuses an unvalidated plan.

If the plan file already exists when the command runs, skip straight to the validation checkpoint: show the summary and ask.

Write no code. This command produces a plan, not code.

End with: "Plan validated. Next: /ks-execute <id>" — or "Plan awaiting validation. Rerun /ks-plan <id> to validate." if it wasn't validated.
