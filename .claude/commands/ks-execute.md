# ks-execute — Delegated implementation

Target story: $ARGUMENTS

## Execution contract (non-negotiable)
You MUST complete this command by delegating to the `implementer` subagent. You are FORBIDDEN from:
- Writing or modifying code yourself — you don't have the Write/Edit/Bash tools, on purpose.
- Starting the implementation without a validated plan in docs/plans/<id>.md.
- Summarizing work the agent didn't actually do.

If you can't invoke the Agent tool, stop and report the error. Don't improvise.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Prerequisites (fail-closed)
1. Resolve $ARGUMENTS to the story id (`s<number>-<slug>`) against docs/stories.md. No unambiguous match → list the available stories, STOP.
2. Read docs/plans/<id>.md. If it doesn't exist, STOP: ask for /ks-plan <id> first. Go no further.
3. Check the plan's frontmatter: it must contain `validated: yes`. Otherwise STOP: "Plan not validated. Review it, then rerun /ks-plan <id> to validate."
4. Read docs/reviews/<id>.md if it exists. If it contains `Ship allowed: no`, this is a FIX run: the review findings come first.

### Step 2 — Delegate
Invoke the Agent tool:
- subagent_type: implementer
- description: Implement story <id> in TDD
- prompt: Implement story <id> from docs/plans/<id>.md, following docs/architecture.md and AGENTS.md. Work on branch feature/<id> — create it from the default branch if it doesn't exist, check it out otherwise; never commit to the default branch. Strict TDD, task by task: failing test → code → passing test, checkbox ticked. One single commit at the end of the story, carrying the story docs and every task — never one commit per task. Implement only what the plan specifies. The tdd-skill is preloaded in your context.
- On a FIX run, prepend to the prompt: This story was blocked in review. Fix every critical and major finding from docs/reviews/<id>.md first, test-first, then finish any unimplemented plan task.

Wait for the agent to finish. Capture its summary.

### Step 3 — Report
Summarize: tasks done, files touched, tests added, and any blocker the agent reported. No line-by-line detail.

End with: "Implementation done. Next step: /ks-review <id>"
