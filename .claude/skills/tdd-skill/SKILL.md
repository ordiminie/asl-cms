# Agentic TDD

For each task in the plan:
1. Write a failing test that describes the expected behavior.
2. Run it and watch it fail. This step is not optional: a test you never saw fail proves nothing.
3. Write the minimum code to make it pass.
4. Run the suite. Refactor if needed, tests always green.
5. Tick the task's checkbox in the plan. No commit here.

Rules:
- No production code without a test motivating it.
- Test behavior, not implementation: assert what the user gets, not which internal function got called.
- Minimal scope: YAGNI. Implement the task, nothing more.
- One commit per story, not per task, tests green at commit. It carries the code of every task and the plan file with its checkboxes ticked — the plan is the live progress tracker, never a commit trigger.

Failure modes — and what to do:
- The new test passes immediately → it doesn't test the new behavior. Rewrite the test, not the code.
- The tests can't run (broken setup, missing runner) → stop and report. Never "skip testing just this once".
- The test is flaky (passes and fails across runs) → fix the flakiness before moving on; a flaky test guards nothing.
- The task is untestable as written → the plan is wrong at that point. Stop and report; don't improvise.
